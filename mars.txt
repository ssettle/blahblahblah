Probably more exciting than being here
In fact I think I'd rather be there right now
Whether I have a spacesuit or not is immaterial
It's better either way

It's 2:00 now
That should mean I've only been here for five hours
It feels like at least five years
Maybe I'm not on Mars
Maybe it's like in Interstellar where time is different
